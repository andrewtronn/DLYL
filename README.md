## Primary Responsibilities
 * Ran weekly scrum sprints, created kanban board, and assinged tasks to team

 * In charge of implementing oAuth 2.0 authentication through Linkedin
 * Designed and implemented users profile page 
 * Designed and implemented navigation bar
 * Designed sign up page

 ## Challenges
 1. oAuth 2.0 authentication
 2. Using token authentication on the log in and sign up pages

 ## Solution
 1. Researched and read documentation to understand oAuth integration. Each social site has a different way of implementing oAuth, finding information specifically for Linkedin was crucial.
 2. Researched for current methods of storing tokens and how to use them.

 ## What I would do differently
 Its difficult to predict every obstacle that may arise, but I would not assume that I will find the answer right away. Some solutions require days of research and deep searches.
